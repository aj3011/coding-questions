/*
Handling overflow and underflow conditions:
If the integer is positive, for 32 bit signed integer, INT_MAX is 2147483647 (2^31 âˆ’ 1). To avoid integer overflow, we must ensure that it doesn't exceed this value.
This condition needs to be handled when the result is greater than or equal to INT_MAX/10 (214748364)

Case 1: If result = INT_MAX/10, it would result in integer overflow if next integer character is greater than 7.
(7 in this case is last digit of INT_MAX(2147483647)). We can use INT_MAX % 10 to generically represent the last digit.

Case 2: If result > INT_MAX/10, we are sure that adding next number would result in integer overflow.
Similarly, This can be ysed for negative numbers also.
